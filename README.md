## 🚀 Purpose
This repository is my **SwiftUI learning lab**, where I explore one topic at a time through small, focused mini-projects.  
Instead of building one big app, I’m breaking down iOS development into **bite-sized experiments**.  

The goal: **master fundamentals by isolating concepts**, then gradually combine them into more complex, real-world projects.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Focus on **one SwiftUI concept at a time**.  
- Build a **library of reference projects** I can revisit later.  
- Practice writing **clean, modular, and reusable code**.  
- Gain confidence moving from **basics → intermediate → advanced SwiftUI**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SwiftUI**  
- **Swift** (latest stable version)  
- **Xcode** (latest stable version)  
- Local JSON files, mock APIs, and external services (e.g., Supabase, Firebase) for backend practice

## 📝 Notes
This repo is **not a polished app**—it’s a personal playground.  
I break things, experiment, and document what I learn.  
Over time, this will grow into a **reference library** of SwiftUI experiments I can reuse in future projects.
