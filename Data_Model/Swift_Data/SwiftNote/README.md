## Project Overview

SwiftNote is a lightweight personal note-taking app built with **SwiftUI** and **SwiftData**.  
It is designed as a learning project to explore modern data modeling, persistence, and CRUD operations in iOS development.  

The app allows users to quickly create, edit, and organize notes while keeping data persistent across app launches.  

---

## Technologies Used

- **SwiftUI** ‚Äì Declarative framework for building responsive UIs  
- **SwiftData** ‚Äì Modern Apple framework for data persistence  
- **MVVM Architecture** ‚Äì Clean separation of views and business logic  
- **Xcode 16+** ‚Äì Development environment for building and running the app  

---

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete notes  
- Mark notes as favorites for quick access  
- Persistent storage with SwiftData (notes saved automatically)  
- Notes displayed in a responsive, sectioned list  
- Notes sorted by creation date  
- **Favorites View** to quickly access important notes  
- **Animated action buttons** for favorite, edit, and delete  
- **Sample data** for SwiftUI previews  

---

## Why This Challenge?

This project was created to:

* Practice **SwiftData** CRUD operations
* Explore data modeling for persistent storage
* Build a **scalable project structure** for learning purposes
* Combine **UI and data logic** in a small, real-world app
* Experiment with **animated toolbar and action buttons**  

---

## What I Learned

* Designing SwiftData `@Model` entities for persistent storage  
* Implementing **Create, Read, Update, Delete** functionality in SwiftUI  
* Querying, filtering, and sorting data with SwiftData APIs  
* Organizing project folders for scalable learning projects  
* Integrating SwiftUI views with persistent data  
* Refactoring UI components (ex:`NoteActionButtonsView`) for reusability  
* Implementing previews using **sample data** (`Note.sampleNotes`)  
* Creating a **Favorites view** with filtered notes  

---

## What I Would Do Differently

* Implement a **search bar** to filter notes  
* Add **tags or categories** for better note organization  
* Integrate **iCloud sync** for cross-device access  
* Refine the **UI** with themes, animations, and better accessibility  
* Add **swipe actions** for edit and delete directly in the list
