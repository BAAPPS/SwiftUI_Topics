# SwiftData

---

## Project Overview

This folder contains mini-projects focused on **working with SwiftData** in SwiftUI.
Each project demonstrates how to **model, persist, and query data locally** using Apple’s SwiftData framework.

The goal is to gain confidence with:

* **Defining SwiftData models** that represent your app’s data
* **Performing CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Using **SwiftData relationships and queries** for nested and linked data
* **Integrating SwiftData with SwiftUI views** for reactive and dynamic interfaces

By the end, you’ll be able to build **fully local data-driven apps** with robust and maintainable data layers.

---

## Technologies Used

* **Swift** (latest stable version)
* **SwiftUI**
* **SwiftData** for local persistence
* **Xcode** (latest stable version)
* **@Model, @Attribute, @Relationship** property wrappers for modeling
* SwiftData **querying, filtering, and sorting APIs**
* SwiftUI **state management** with `@Query`, `@State`, and `@Observable`

---

## Sub-Projects

Each sub-project focuses on a specific type of local data modeling challenge:

* [SwiftNote](./SwiftNote) → Build a note-taking app with SwiftData. Practice creating **notes, categories, and tags**, handling relationships, and syncing data with SwiftUI lists and detail views.

<!--* [TodoManager](./TodoManager) → Model a **task management system** with priorities, due dates, and status flags. Practice sorting, filtering, and updating tasks in real-time.-->
<!---->
<!--* [MovieLibrary](./MovieLibrary) → Persist **movies, actors, and genres** locally. Practice **nested relationships**, querying with conditions, and linking data to SwiftUI grids and detail views.-->

---

## Why This Challenge?

SwiftData is the **future of local persistence** in SwiftUI apps. By working with SwiftData, you:

* Learn how to define **robust data models** with relationships
* Practice **CRUD operations** in a real SwiftUI app
* Handle **querying, filtering, and sorting** efficiently
* Understand how to **reactively bind local data to SwiftUI views**
* Lay the foundation for **offline-first or hybrid apps**

This experience is critical for building apps that require **structured local storage** without relying on Core Data boilerplate.
