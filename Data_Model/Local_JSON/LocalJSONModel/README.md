# LocalJSONModel

---

## Project Overview

This project is a focused exploration of working with **local JSON files** in SwiftUI.  
The goal is to practice **encoding and decoding JSON data**, creating **Swift data models**, and displaying the information in a SwiftUI view.  

This mini-project serves as a foundation for understanding **data modeling**, which is essential for both local and networked data handling in iOS apps.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Swift** (latest stable version)  
- **SwiftUI**  
- **Xcode** (latest stable version)  
- Local JSON files for mock data  
- `Codable` protocol for encoding and decoding  

---

## Features
- Load data from a **local JSON file** bundled with the app  
- Decode JSON into **Swift structs**  
- Display data dynamically in a **List or Grid view**  
- Handle optional or missing data gracefully  
- Modular and reusable data model structures  

---

## Why This Challenge?
Working with local JSON files is a **core skill for iOS development** because:  
- It helps you understand how data flows from a file into your app  
- Teaches safe decoding with `Codable`  
- Prepares you for working with **remote JSON APIs** later  
- Encourages clean **data modeling practices**
