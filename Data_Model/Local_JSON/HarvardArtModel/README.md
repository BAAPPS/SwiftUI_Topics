# HarvardArtModel

---

## Project Overview
**HarvardArtModel** is a SwiftUI project that models and displays art data from the Harvard Art Museums API. The app decodes local JSON files representing art objects, including details such as title, artist, date, medium, and images. Users can browse artworks in a fullscreen layout and view detailed information for each piece.

## Technologies Used
- **Swift** (latest stable version)  
- **SwiftUI**  
- **Xcode** (latest stable version)  
- Local JSON files (exported from Harvard Art Museums API)  
- `Codable` protocol for encoding and decoding  

---

## Features
- Decode and model art objects from JSON data  
- Display artwork images in a responsive fullscreen layout (TikTok-like scrolling)  
- Show detailed information for selected artworks  
- Use SwiftUI views and navigation for a smooth user experience  
- Accessibility-friendly design, including labels for images and buttons

## Why This Challenge?
This project provides hands-on experience with:
- Data modeling using real-world APIs  
- Handling nested JSON and multiple related entities  
- SwiftUI layouts for dynamic and adaptive interfaces  
- Best practices for accessibility and reusable UI components
