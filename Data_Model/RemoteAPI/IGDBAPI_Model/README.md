# IGDBAPI_Model

---

## Project Overview
This project explores working with the [IGDB (Internet Games Database) API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#examples) to fetch and model video game data.  
The focus is on building **Swift data models** that can handle IGDBâ€™s **complex, nested JSON responses**, and then displaying that data in SwiftUI views.  

This project demonstrates how to connect to a real-world API that requires **OAuth authentication**, parse the data, and present it in a user-friendly way.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Swift** (latest stable version)  
- **SwiftUI**  
- **Xcode** (latest stable version)  
- `URLSession` with **async/await** for API requests  
- `Codable` for JSON decoding  
- **OAuth 2.0 authentication** for API access  

---

## Features
- Authenticate with IGDB using OAuth 2.0 and client credentials  
- Fetch game data including:  
  - Game titles, cover art, and genres  
  - Release dates and platforms  
  - Developers and publishers  
- Decode deeply nested JSON into Swift models using `Codable`  
- Display data in **SwiftUI lists, grids, and detail views**  
- Handle optional and missing fields gracefully  
- Reusable SwiftUI components for clean UI structure

## Why This Challenge?
This project provides hands-on experience with:

* Data modeling using real-world APIs and local JSON  
* Handling nested JSON structures and multiple related entities  
* SwiftUI layouts for dynamic and adaptive interfaces  
* Accessibility best practices and reusable UI components  
* Creating a smooth, interactive browsing experience similar to modern media apps
