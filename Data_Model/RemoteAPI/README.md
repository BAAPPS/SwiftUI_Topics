# RemoteAPIs

---

## Project Overview
This folder contains mini-projects focused on working with **remote APIs** in SwiftUI.  
Each project demonstrates how to fetch, decode, and display data from different APIs while practicing **networking, data modeling, and error handling**.  

The goal is to gain confidence with **`URLSession`**, **async/await**, and **`Codable`**, while learning how to adapt to different API structures.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Swift** (latest stable version)  
- **SwiftUI**  
- **Xcode** (latest stable version)  
- `URLSession` for networking  
- `Codable` for JSON decoding  
- Async/Await for modern concurrency

## Sub-Projects
<!--- [RAWGAPI_Model](./RAWGAPI_Model) → Explore the [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) for games, genres, and platforms  -->
- [IGDBAPI_Model](./IGDBAPI_Model) → Explore the [IGDB (Internet Games Database) API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#examples) for games, companies, and platforms  

---

## Why This Challenge?
APIs are the backbone of modern apps. By working with different APIs:  
- I learn how to read and interpret **API documentation**  
- Practice building **data models** that match remote JSON schemas  
- Handle **authentication** (IGDB uses OAuth2 while RAWG uses API keys)  
- Get comfortable with **error handling, rate limits, and optional fields**  
- Build a foundation for **larger full-stack projects** in the future
